## Install instructions

IGL only supports and recommends the use of Anaconda. However, the environment can be set up using only `pip`
by installing the IGL bindings from source.

The general steps are as follow:

1. Install PyTorch according to your system
2. See the `requirements.txt` file to check the needed packages
    - This is usually done with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, but Anaconda may have a different way of doing things
3. Install IGL bindings ( https://github.com/libigl/libigl-python-bindings )
4. Install Kaolin ( https://kaolin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html )
